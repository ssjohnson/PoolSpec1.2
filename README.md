#PoolSpec1.2

###PoolSpec App V 1.2

This is a iOS application which I wrote for internal use within my place of work at this time. The application was designed to allow the user to identify a pool he was present at, and fill out a form identifying any product or construction orders required, attach photographs of the aforementioned issues, and compress the information into an email to someone in the office to create a bid. 

The application is fully functional, but was never deployed around the company due to a professional service building a large scale corporate version of the idea which would interact with our CRM software.

This was also my first ever attempt at an iOS application and anything using Objective - C. It was a great learning experience, but my code ended up being very sloppy and poorly designed. 

Also, my mac died and has yet to be replaced, which can considerably hinder the process of creating a native iOS application. :(
